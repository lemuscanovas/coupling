\title{Calculate Upper Pi (Î ) for Estimating Long-term Coupling Evidences}
\usage{
upper_pi(H, Hp, tas)
}
\arguments{
\item{H}{An SpatRaster representing the actual energy balance
measurements in watts per square meter (W/m^2).}

\item{Hp}{An SpatRaster representing the potential energy balance
measurements in watts per square meter (W/m^2).}

\item{tas}{An SpatRaster representing the air temperature
measurements in degrees Celsius.}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric value representing the difference between the Pearson
  correlation coefficients of H and tas, and Hp and tas. This difference is used
  as an indicator of coupling, with greater values indicating stronger coupling.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Upper Pi (\(Pi\)) to estimate long-term coupling
evidences between variables. It is used to assess the degree of coupling between
energy balance components (H and Hp) and air temperature (tas), where greater
values of Pi indicate greater coupling. The function computes the Pearson
correlation coefficients between the standard deviation series (sds) of H and
tas, and Hp and tas, respectively. The difference between these two correlation
coefficients is then returned as the measure of coupling.
}
\details{
The function internally uses two helper functions, `sds` and `lapp`,
  which are assumed to perform standard deviation series calculation and a
  custom application of a function over matrices, respectively. It calculates
  the Pearson correlation coefficient within each row for H against tas and
  Hp against tas using `cor` with the method "pearson" and handling missing
  values with "pairwise.complete.obs".
}
\note{
It is important to ensure that H, Hp, and tas are aligned in terms of
  their dimensions and represent comparable time series or spatial data points.
  The function assumes that missing values are handled appropriately before
  passing to the correlation calculation.
