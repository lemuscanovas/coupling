\title{Calculate Energy Balance (H or Hp)}
\usage{
energy_balance(Rn, l, E)
}
\arguments{
\item{Rn}{Net radiation at the surface in joules per square meter (J/m^2).}

\item{l}{Latent heat of vaporization in megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg).}

\item{E_evap}{Evaporation (actual E or potential Ep) in millimeters (mm).
This represents the water amount that evaporates or is potentially evaporated.}

\item{time_period}{The time period over which the energy is expended, in seconds.
Default is 86400 (1 day).}
}
\value{
Returns the energy balance (H or Hp) in watts per square meter (W/m^2).
  The formula used for the calculation is:
  \eqn{H = \frac{Rn}{time\_period} - \left(\frac{l \times E \times 10^6}{time\_period}\right)},
  where \code{time_period} is 86400 seconds (1 day). The factor of \eqn{10^6}
  converts l from MJ/kg to J/kg for accurate computation.
}
\description{
This function calculates the energy balance in watts per square meter (W/m^2),
taking into account either actual (E) or potential (Ep) evaporation. The calculation
is based on the net radiation (Rn), the latent heat of vaporization (l), and
evaporation (E or Ep). The function adheres to the ECMWF convention that vertical
fluxes are positive downwards.
}
\details{
The function accounts for the conversion of the energy used for
  evaporation from joules to watts by dividing by the time period over which
  the energy is expended (1 day = 86400 seconds). This conversion is essential
  for representing the energy balance in terms of power (W/m^2).
}
\note{
Caution: The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.
  This function conforms to this convention by adjusting the calculation of
  the energy balance accordingly.
